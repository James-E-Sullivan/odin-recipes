    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        Baked eggplant Parmesan is a satisfying Italian-inspired meal consisting of 
        eggplant slices coated with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese baked between 
        layers of tomato sauce and more cheese!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar garlic-and-tomato pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place eggplant slices in a colander; sprinkle both sides of each slice 
            with salt. Allow to sit for at least 3 hours. Wipe excess moisture from 
            eggplant slices with paper towels.
        </li>

        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mix bread crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese together in a shallow bowl. 
            Beat eggs in a separate shallow bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            Dip eggplant slices in beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into 
            the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides; arrange coated 
            eggplant slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crisp, about 5 
            minutes per side.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish with a layer of pasta sauce; 
            top with a layer of eggplant slices. Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of 
            the remaining Parmesan cheese and 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat 
            layers with remaining ingredients, ending with a cheese layer. 
            Sprinkle with basil.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and golden brown, 
            about 35 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
