    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 pounds pork shoulder, cut into several large pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season pork 
            shoulder pieces with salt, then arrange in the Dutch oven. Cook until 
            browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in onion, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, oregano, and cumin. 
            Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, 
            and simmer until pork is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 decrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid. 
            Drizzle a small amount of cooking liquid over pork and lightly season 
            with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake pork in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Drizzle 
            more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred pork as it 
            browns.
        </li>
